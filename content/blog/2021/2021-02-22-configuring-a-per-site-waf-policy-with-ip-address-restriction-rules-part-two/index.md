In [Part one](https://docs.rackspace.com/blog/configuring-a-per-site-waf-policy-with-ip-address-restriction-rules-part-one/)
of this three-part series, I introduced the concept of the per-site web application firewall
(WAF) Policy with IP address rule restrictions and set the stage for this demonstration.
Part one also lays out the assumptions for the implementation walkthrough. In this post,
I present the Application Gateway configuration.

### Application Gateway configuration

My Application Gateway is already provisioned, so let me share the relevant settings that
I configured.

#### Web Application Firewall 

1. Under the Configure tab, I have WAF V2 as the selected Tier, Firewall Status enabled
   and in Prevention mode. I did not create any exclusions and I left the Global parameters
   with the default settings.

<br>
</br>

2. On the Rules tab, I left the default ruleset of OWASP 3.0 and Advanced rule
   configuration disabled. 

#### Backend Pool

I have my Windows VM (or rather itâ€™s NIC) added as a backend target to a pool I created
called `vmPool01`.

<br>
</br>

#### HTTP Settings

1. I created an object for each website:

- **HttpSettings01**: corresponding to **site1.hiteshvadgama.co.uk**
- **HttpSettings02**: corresponding to **site2.hiteshvadgama.co.uk**

{{<img src="Picture4.png" title="" alt="">}}

<br>
</br>

2. In the configuration for each object, I have the following:

- **Backend protocol/port**: Because this is purely for testing, I selected `HTTP/80`.
- **Cookie-based affinity**: `disabled`
- **Connection draining**: `disabled`
- **Request time-out (seconds)**: Default of `20`
- **Override with new hostname**: `yes`
- **Override with specific domain name**: Selected. Because I have two websites running on
  the same VM, I need to select this option and specify the website URL so that the system
  forwards requests to the correct site based on the incoming host header.
   - For **HTTPSettings01**, I specified `site1.hiteshvadgama.co.uk` as the domain name
   - For **HTTPSettings02**, I specified `site2.hiteshvadgama.co.uk `as the domain name
- **Custom Probe**: I created a custom probe for each website and assigned each to the
  respective HTTP Setting object for health monitoring purposes.

The following screenshot shows the **HttpSettings01** object for reference:

<br>
</br>

#### Frontend IP configurations

The Application Gateway has a public IP address that I used to create DNS A records to map
my two websites.

<br>
</br>

#### Listeners

1. I created a Listener for each website. The custom WAF rule needs this to work because I
   associate the rule to a specific Listener later so it impacts only one website.

- **Site1_Listener**: corresponding to **site1.hiteshvadgama.co.uk**
- **Site2_Listener**: corresponding to **site2.hiteshvadgama.co.uk**

{{<img src="Picture7.png" title="" alt="">}}

<br>
</br>
 
2. In the configuration for each Listener, I have the following:

- **Frontend IP**: `public`
- **Port**: `80`
- **Associated Rule**: I created a routing rule for each website and associated it to the
  respective Listener. I cover routing rules in the next section.
- **Listener Type**: Because I have more than one hosted site, I selected `Multi site`.
- **Host name**: I entered the URL corresponding to the respective website.

Following is a screenshot of the **Site1_Listener** for reference:

{{<img src="Picture8.png" title="" alt="">}}

<br>
</br>

#### Rules

1. I created a routing rule for each Listener:

- **Site1_Rule**: corresponding to `Site1_Listener`
- **Site2_Rule**: corresponding to `Site2_Listener`

2. For **Site1_Rule** backend targets, I have a **backend pool** (`vmPool01`) and the
   **HTTPSettings01** object.

{{<img src="Picture9.png" title="" alt="">}}

<br>
</br>

3. For **Site2_Rule** backend targets, I again have **backend pool** (`vmPool01`) but this
   time with the **HTTPSettings02** object.
