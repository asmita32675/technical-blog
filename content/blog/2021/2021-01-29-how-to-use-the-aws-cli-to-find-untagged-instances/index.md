I often need to find AWS&reg; EC2&reg; instances without a particular tag. Usually, it's
the **Name** tag, but other tags come up from time to time (we use a tag of `Owner` quite
a bit).

### Use the AWS CLI to find instances without a *Name* tag

After coming across [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/5unh0g/finding_ec2_instances_which_lack_a_certain_tag/)
and [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18858120/finding-all-amazon-aws-instances-that-do-not-have-a-certain-tag),
we made it our mission to figure out how to get instances that were missing a tag through
the AWS command line interface (CLI) instead of using external tools like jq or python.

### The --Query Parameter, JMESPath, and filtering

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) is the engine behind the **--query** parameter in AWS
CLI. In its most basic form, it helps you filter out or traverse JSON. AWS has
[some nice documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-output.html)
describing how to use it at a basic level. In this post, we focus on the filtering ability
of JMESPath.

Using the bracket and a question mark triggers the JMESPath filter: `[? ... ]`

#### Find an instance with a specific tag

For example, many people want to get the instance **Name** tag and the **InstanceId**. You
can do this by using the filter for the `Tags -> Key=='Name'`, as shown in the following
example:

    aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --output text \
     --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0],InstanceId]'

#### Find an instance without a tag

While this is useful, we actually want to do the opposite. So, we start by diving down into
each instance:

    aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --query 'Reservations[].Instances[]'

This operation spits out each of the instances. Then, we create a filter on each of these
where the **Name** tag doesn't exist. A tag that exists would look similar to the following
example:

    aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?Tags[?Key != `Name`]]'

The problem with this filter is that as we loop through the **Tags** array, we'll most
likely hit an instance with more than one tag. That instance registers `true` because the
first tag may have `"Key:" "SomeTag"` (but the second could be `"Key:" "Name"`). So we want
to look for the object with the **Name** key but with no value (aka `null`).

#### Solution

First, lets get the value from the **Name** tag:

    aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value'

Now we can use the JMESPath **not_null()** function to filter for ones that exist:

    aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?not_null(Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value)]'

The problem is that this still captures anything *with* a **Name** tag. So we negate it.
That is, we want anything that *isn't* `not_null` [aka not not null]!

    aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?!not_null(Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value)]'

This operation returns something similar to the following:

    [
      [
        {
            "Monitoring": {
                "State": "disabled"
            }, 
            "PublicDnsName": "", 
            "RootDeviceType": "ebs"
            ...
        }
      ], 
      [], 
      [], 
      [], 
      [], 
      [], 
      [], 
      [
        {
            "Monitoring": {
                "State": "disabled"
            }, 
            "PublicDnsName": "", 
            "RootDeviceType": "ebs"
            ...
        }
      ], 
      []
    ]

We don't want to have these empty arrays, so we flatten the instance object with a pipe:

    aws ec2 describe-instances \
      --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?!not_null(Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value)] | []'

And that's it! 

#### Other examples

If you want a few more examples of some common uses, here you go:

- Display InstanceId of instances that have no Name tag:

        aws ec2 describe-instances \
          --output text \
          --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?!not_null(Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value)] | [].[InstanceId]'
 
- Display InstanceId of running instances that have no Owner tag:

        aws ec2 describe-instances \
          --output text \
          --filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=running \
          --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?!not_null(Tags[?Key == `Owner`].Value)] | [].[InstanceId]'
 
- Display VolumeId and Size of volumes that have no Name tag:

        aws ec2 describe-volumes \
          --output text \
          --query 'Volumes[?!not_null(Tags[?Key == `Name`].Value)] | [].[VolumeId,Size]'
 
- Display SnapshotId and StartTime of my snapshots that have no CreatedBy tag:

        aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
          --output text \
          --owner-ids self \
          --query 'Snapshots[?!not_null(Tags[?Key == `CreatedBy`].Value)] | [].[SnapshotId,StartTime]'

### Why search for untagged instances with AWS CLI?

There are many reasons to tag instances, including
[automation and console organization](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-tagging-best-practices.pdf),
but at Rackspace Technology Onica, our biggest driver is *cost*. Employing a tagging policy to
help track your instances' cost allocation is an important step in optimizing your AWS cost!
