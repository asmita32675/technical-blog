We are excited to announce enhanced full-lifecycle cloud-native development
Professional Services capabilities to better help our customers build modern
applications for the future.

Early cloud adoption approaches focused on migrating applications and
infrastructure with minimal changes to the code or architecture. While these
migrated workloads sometimes benefit from the elasticity and scale of the cloud,
unlocking additional value requires modernizing the application code and
architecture to be more cloud native.

This enhanced portfolio of services helps you develop modern applications that
take advantage of cloud-native technologies and microservices architectures. From
ideation and user experience design to development and deployment, we work
alongside you to re-engineer your legacy applications and build new modern
applications that maximize the agility, reliability, and cost-saving benefits of
the cloud.

### Why are businesses embracing modern cloud-native applications?

Our customers see the long-term value of transitioning to cloud-native
architecture while leveraging our AWS expertise across the following use cases:

- Eliminate Windows licenses.
- Break up the monolith into microservices.
- Refactor legacy on-prem desktop applications and deliver them in a SaaS model
  through cloud-based web or mobile applications.
- Build real-time event-driven companion applications for IoT solutions.

While companies take steps toward modernizing their applications,  the complexity
of public cloud technologies and modern architectures and the new processes and
development workflows that come with them can block progress.  

There is no one-size-fits-all pathway to modernization. That is why we've
developed multiple paths to help customers on their journey to cloud-native
development through services that range from assessment and advisory to enablement
and modernization at scale. Our architects assess your applications and
infrastructure in the context of your business goal and your team's strengths to
determine which combination of cloud technologies and architectural patterns best
fits your long-term roadmap. We can help you modernize your existing application
with serverless refactoring and containers to get the benefits of going cloud
native. We offer an incremental approach to modernization or build net-new, modern
cloud-native applications with end-to-end software development services that
leverage serverless, microservices architectures and modern operations.  

### Where we can help

We can help you with the following aspects of your cloud-native journey:

- **Serverless refactoring**: Build self-healing, auto-scaling, applications,
  unchained from the limitations of servers. Serverless architectures offer the
  highest efficiency and cost benefits of the cloud by pushing nearly all
  infrastructure and software management to the platform.
- **Container adoption**: When serverless isn't an option, many prefer containers
  for deploying modern, complex, distributed applications. Containers often require
  minimal changes to the application, making them the perfect evolutionary step
  when significant refactoring isn't appropriate.
- **Cloud-Native Replatforming**: Incrementally modernize your application by
   adopting managed platform services as drop-in replacements for databases,
   messaging, API management, logging, monitoring, alerting, and more.

Ultimately, we want to provide our customers with a selection of services based
on their readiness to adopt so that you can plan your modernization roadmap
with confidence. We've developed the following paths to help you better unlock
the full potential of the cloud:

- Free two-hour strategy session on the Application Modernization Assessment &
  Advisory service {add link?}
- AWS Serverless Enablement & Ideation Workshop {add link?}
- Application Modernization at Scale {add link?}
