The post introduces Oracle Identity Cloud Service (IDCS) integration with the existing
Oracle&reg; e-Business Suite&reg; (EBS) environments.

<!--more-->

### Introduction
 
IDCS is an Oracle cloud-based Identity platform, which enables SSO services to access EBS
applications. It does not require any installations. Oracle Cloud maintains everything,
including backup, recovery, patching, upgrade, and scaling.

You need only one component called EBS Asserter, which IDCS provides to implement SSO
for Oracle e-Business Suite and other applications.

### Features of EBS Asserter

Asserter has the following key features:

- You don't need to make configuration changes to EBS.
- You should deploy in WebLogic 12C with SSL configuration.
- It supports single login for EBS applications, IDCS, and EBS Asserter.
- It has multiple access modes for SSO with EBS.

In IDCS, you can also integrate with the existing active directory (AD). To integrate IDCS
with an existing AD, you need to download the Oracle IDCS AD agent from IDCS and install
it on the AD server by providing client ID and client secret details. After the installation
completes, the system updates the AD server details in the IDCS directory integrations.

To synchronize AD users, you need to configure the bridge and perform synchronization.

Following is an illustration of the new approach of EBS integration with IDCS:

### EBS Integration with IDCS for SSO

Oracle supports all EBS modules having browser-based logins to work with EBS Asserter and
also supports Excel&reg;-based logins for Web ADI. Mobile Apps for EBS don't use
browser-based authentication, so Mobile apps are not supported.

### Installation prerequisites

To install EBS Asserter, make sure you have the following elements in place:

- Oracle JRE/JDK version 8 or later
- Java Cryptography Extension file for Java&reg; 8
- Access to the IDCS console to download the EBS Asserter and permission to register
  confidential applications.
- Access to EBS applications.
- A separate Oracle WebLogic server 12C and a new managed server, **EBSAsserter_server**,
  where you can deploy the EBS Asserter Java application. This WebLogic server and EBS
  servers must be in the same domain.

According to [Oracle Asserter documentation](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/ebs_asserter_obe/ebs-asserter.html),
you should perform the following steps before installing the EBS Asserter:

1. Download and extract the EBS Asserter zip file.
2. Access the Identity Cloud Service console, expand the **NavigationDrawer**, click
   **Settings**, and click **Downloads**. Click **Download** to download IDCS EBS Asserter,
   and then save the zip file.
3. Extract the contents of the EBS Asserter zip file.
4. Copy the **ebs.war** and **idcs-wallet-<version>.jar** files to a working folder into
   the EBS Asserter's WebLogic Server machine.

Make sure the EBS Asserter URL has access over the SSL.

If you have multiple EBS instances, you can configure and deploy EBS Asserter for each EBS
instance. You can use the same WebLogic server for all EBS Asserter-managed servers.

### Configuration steps

Perform the following configuration steps:

##### 1. Create an application user on EBS

To create a user for EBS Asserter to communicate with EBS applications, perform the
following steps from the [Oracle Asserter documentation](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/ebs_asserter_obe/ebs-asserter.html):

1. Log in to EBS as the **sysadmin** user.
2. Go to **User Management Responsibility** and click **Users**.
3. Select **User Account** from the **Register** drop-down menu and click **Go**.
4. On the **Create User Account** page, enter the following details to create a new user,
   and click **Submit**:

     - **Username**: `EBSASSERTER`
     - **Password**: The user password.
     - **Description**: `EBS Asserter Service User`
     - **Password Expire**: None

5. After user creation, click **Assign roles**, and then click **Assign roles** on the
   **Update User** page.
6. Use **Search and Select: Assign Roles** by code `UMX|APPS_SCHEMA_CONNECT`.
7. Select **Apps Schema Connect Role** and click **Select**. 
8. Provide justification as **EBS asserter service user** and click **Save**.

##### 2. Create EBS system administrator in IDCS

Perform the following steps from [Oracle Asserter documentation](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/ebs_asserter_obe/ebs-asserter.html)
to create a user in IDCS that communicates to the system administrator in EBS applications.

1. Log in to IDCS to access the console.
2. In the IDCS console, expand the navigation, click **Users**, and click **Add** on the
   **Users** page.
3. In the **Add User** window, provide the following values and click **Finish**:

     - **First Name**: `EBS`
     - **Last Name**: `Sysadmin`
     - Uncheck **Use the email address as the username**.
     - **Username**: `sysadmin`
     - **Email**: Provide the email address set to the SYSADMIN account in your Oracle E-Business Suite.

4. After you create the user in IDCS, log in to EBS applications and update the sysadmin
user email address to match the IDCS sysadmin address.

##### 3. Register the EBS Asserter with EBS applications

Perform the following steps from [Oracle Asserter documentation](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/ebs_asserter_obe/ebs-asserter.html)
to register the EBS Asserter with EBS:

1. Log in to the EBS application server as `applmgr` and identify the directories for
   **$JAVA_HOME** and **$WLS_HOME**.
2. Run the following commands to create a working directory:

        cd /u01/app/SID
        mkdir ebssdk
        cd ebssdk

3. Extract **fndext.jar** from **ebs.war**, which you downloaded from IDCS. Copy it both
   to the working directory and the EBS asserter WebLogic server **$DOMAIN\_HOME/lib** folder.
4. Source the EBS environment file and run the following commands to register EBS asserter
   with EBS applications:

        cd /u01/app/SID/ebssdk
        java oracle.apps.fnd.security.AdminDesktop apps/<apps_pwd> CREATE NODE_NAME=ebsasserter.example.com DBC=$FND_SECURE/EBSDB.dbc

5. Copy the generated **EBSDB_ebsasserter.example.com.dbc** file to the EBS Asserter server and make a note of the **APPL_SERVER_ID**.
 
##### 4. Register EBS Asserter in IDCS

Perform the following steps from [Oracle Asserter documentation](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/ebs_asserter_obe/ebs-asserter.html) to create a confidential application to represent EBS asserter:

1. Log in to the IDCS console and expand the navigation and then click applications.
2. Click on Add and select Confidential applications in the dialog box

##### 5. Create a WebLogic wallet

According to [Oracle Asserter documentation](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/ebs_asserter_obe/ebs-asserter.html),
for security purposes, you need to register client ID, client secret, and IDCS URL in the
wallet used by the EBS asserter.  Perform the following steps described in the Oracle
documentation:

1. Log in to the EBS Asserter server and go to the directory where the
   **idcs-wallet-<version>.jar** file exists.

2. Run the following command to generate the **cwallet.sso** file and fill in the details
   as prompted:

        java -jar idcs-wallet-<version>.jar  

     - **Enter Wallet Path**: Enter the path to the store wallet file.
     - **Enter Client ID**: Enter the **Client ID**.

details.

##### 7. Deploy EBS Asserter

Perform the following steps from
[Oracle Asserter documentation](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/idcs/ebs_asserter_obe/ebs-asserter.html)
