Here at Rackspace Technology, we always look for creative ways to solve technical
challenges, such as how to make data available across applications.

For example, how can we make data from back-end systems visible to sales or
customer-service users in Salesforce&reg;? The simplest way to do this is to sync the
data between the systems by using a scheduled batch process to extract, transform,
and then load the data from the external systems into Salesforce.

However, this approach often proves troublesome, particularly if you need to sync
large volumes of reference data in Salesforce, which is inefficient. Similarly,
if the data in question contains sensitive information, this might bring up
compliance issues. So, what alternatives are there to that simple approach?

For scenarios like these, we recommend that you use Salesforce Connect and
MuleSoft&reg;.

Salesforce Connect takes data residing in external applications and makes that
data available to users in Salesforce similar to normal objects, like
opportunities or cases. That way, the data visibility is seamless for users,
and Connect handles field visibility and page layouts in the same way that
Salesforce does.

The advantage is that data from these external data sources does not reside on
the Salesforce platform. Instead, Connect retrieves the data in real-time when
a user needs it, such as invoice records for a given account. Connect uses an
application programmer interface (API) for the external system that uses the
Open Data Protocol (OData) standard. If the external system already provides an
API endpoint, setting up the rest is easy.

But what happens if you have multiple back-end applications you want to expose
in Salesforce, or if your applications don't provide OData endpoints? That's
where a tool like MuleSoft comes in.

MuleSoft is a leading API and integration platform that allows organizations to
build, deploy, publish, and share APIs and data integrations by using various
integration patterns. In this scenario, we recommend using MuleSoft to build an
OData-compliant API layer on top of the back-end systems so that you can easily
access data in Salesforce. For example, Salesforce Connect makes an API call to
the OData endpoint built on MuleSoft. Then you configure MuleSoft to query the
back-end systems and format the response to send back to Salesforce. MuleSoft
has a variety of pre-built application and technology connectors for Oracle&reg;,
SAP&reg;, Amazon S3, and databases using a Java&reg; Database Connectivity (JDBC)
connection, as shown in the following image:

The solution, then, is to perform the following tasks:

1. Use Salesforce Connect to surface external data.

2. Use Salesforce Connect to connect to an OData-compliant API endpoint
   provided by MuleSoft.

3. Configure MuleSoft to handle the integration with the back-end systems and
   return the data to the MuleSoft API. This step makes the data available to
   users in Salesforce.
