Application integration is usually a daunting task, largely due to the nature
of different data structures, legacy applications, and a team's overall IT
capabilities. MuleSoft&reg;, a Gartner MQ leader in integration Platform as a
Service (iPaaS), is a premiere choice for systems integrators and
application developers.

### MuleSoft Anypoint

The MuleSoft Anypoint platform offers a centralized web-based management system
for application integrations by using an enterprise service bus (ESB) instead of
usual point-to-point application integrations, where every application connects
to each other. The following image illustrates the ESB:

MuleSoft supports different architectures in its integration capabilities,
including the following architectures:

- Monolithic
- Service-oriented
- Microservices-based

Microservices&mdash;solutions that are either business-process functionalities
or data flow&mdash;include migration, broadcast, aggregation, bidirectional
synchronization, and correlation.

Mule applications include several components such as connectors, which ensure
that enterprises keep running fully-functional application networks without
losing any data. To meet your business need to integrate applications in a hybrid
environment, MuleSoft has many benefits for developers and system integrators.

### MuleSoft features

In addition to conforming to OpenAPI Specifications (OAS)&mdash;the universal standards
programming language interface for application programmer interfaces
(APIs)&mdash;MuleSoft enables you to do the following tasks:

- Create API fragments that developers can save to use in their applications.

- Use the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML), a common, vendor-neutral API
  language that many applications use.

MuleSoft includes the following components:

- **Anypoint Analytics**: Helps you to track API usage and governance, transaction
  data usage analytics, and service level agreement performance.

- **API Designer**: Provides a single window, web-based interface to design,
  document, and test APIs created by using the platform.

- **API Manager**: Enables the administrator to create and manage users on the
  Anypoint platform. It also allows you to track and analyze traffic between
  applications and secure APIs via an API gateway. This function is vital for
  API governance&mdash;a single platform with all these functions helps in
  user-access control and API policy implementation.

- **Anypoint Connectors**: Makes it easy to connect out-of-the-box tools and
  assets. You can connect systems faster, and Anypoint Connectors ensures that
  you don't need to create the API from scratch.

- **Flow Designer**: Helps newcomers to API development. It is a web-based,
  intuitive interface that acts like a wizard and provides guidance in MuleSoft
  API creation. Functionalities include drag and drop features for data and
  assets, auto-populating reusable assets, and a list view of input and output
  data.

- **Anypoint Monitoring**: Provides performance monitoring of the platform in
  real-time, across all integrations and APIs. This component helps with issue
  identification, root cause analyses, dependency mapping, and provides access
  to log data.

- **Anypoint Runtime Manager**: Serves as a useful integrated tool for the
  management and monitoring of a complex hybrid environment of systems, APIs,
  data, and devices. Developers use the Anypoint Runtime Manager to view performance
  across systems, connect third-party operating tools, and set performance
  trigger-based alerts.

- **Anypoint Studio**: Offers a single desktop environment for building and
testing all APIs and integrations, either in Software as a Service (SaaS) or
on-premises systems. Use it before deploying them to CloudHub, or any other
cloud environment, to help developers perform virtually any function, including
mapping, building, editing, and debugging their APIs.
