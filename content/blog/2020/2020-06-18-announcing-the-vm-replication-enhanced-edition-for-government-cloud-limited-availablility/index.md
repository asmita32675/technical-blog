Rackspace Technology is proud to announce the limited availability of the Virtual
Machine (VM) Replication Enhanced Edition for Government.

<!--more-->

Powered by the Zerto&reg; IT Resilience Platform, the VM Replication Enhanced
Edition for Government supports your need to reduce risk and simplify backup,
disaster recovery, and cloud data mobility.

The VM Replication Enhanced Edition for Government provides always-available
backup and recovery to help you ensure operational continuity. This edition
enables you to recover virtual environments, regardless of the threat, including
ransomware, hardware failures, and natural disasters.

The solution is available to Rackspace Government Cloud (RGC) on VMware&reg; customers
in Rackspace Technology data centers.

### Key features

RGC customers benefit from the following VM Replication Enhanced Edition
capabilities:

- Continuous data protection with hypervisor-based block-level replication.

- Consistent recovery of the entire application by protecting multiple VMs
  combined into virtual protection groups.

- Rewind and recover to the second with point-in-time recovery for seamless
  rollback to moments before ransomware with approximately five-second
  increments. You can go back up to seven days.

- Complete automation and orchestration of VM non-disruptive test failovers,
  migrations, and live recoveries with no manual steps.

- Automated testing to ensure recoverability with no impact to production
  high recovery point objectives (RPO) or recovery time objectives (RTO), which
  are measured in seconds, not minutes.

The VM Replication Enhanced Edition for Government is available in conjunction
with our existing RGC on VMware managed security and compliance platform. Our
customers already leverage our platform to significantly shorten the time and
cost required to achieve FedRAMP Authorization to Operate (ATO), often with cost
savings of up to 70%, compared to hiring hourly consultants. With this edition,
our customers can meet even the most rigorous RTO and RPO targets.

Rackspace remains a leader in the FedRAMP authorization enablement space,
powering 12 FedRAMP ATOs built on the Rackspace managed service, and provides
24x7x365 hybrid-cloud management, operational support, and security services as
a packaged, on-demand, audited, and pay-as-you-go service.
